# RandomShapesPY

A Python script that randomly generates a geometric shape (square, circle, triangle, or isosceles trapezoid) and prints its area and perimeter.
The trapezoid intentionally uses an incorrect area formula, as required in the assignment.

The project includes a set of unit tests that verify correct behavior, handle invalid input, and test the random shape generator.
